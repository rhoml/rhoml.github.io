# About

This is the data for Rhommel Lamas [blog](http://rhommell.com/blog "http://rhommell.com/blog") and [website](http://rhommell.com "http://rhommell.com").
I use [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to transform the content of this repo into the static site hosted at [rhommell.com](http://rhommell.com "http://rhommell.com"). This blog is forked from [jasonrudolph.com](https://github.com/jasonrudolph/jasonrudolph.com).
